<h4 id="heading4">A "Brief" Introduction</h4>

What I hope to achieve with this writing corner of my website.

One, writing forces me to think. I write in the hopes of learning, and I hope to not forget, that if some forceful expression of opinion should ever escape in these pages, to afterward test the merits of my own thoughts against those wiser and more experienced. I hope to especially revive an appreciation of the wisdom of ages past, for as CS Lewis argued in one of his essays in "On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature", those born into the same times, even while disagreeing with each other on every contemporary topic they argue over, are still usually operating within the same framework of looking at the world. Our times and milieu have already instructed us (though none of us chose this teacher) on what the important topics to argue over are, what the important questions to ask are (and which ones are apparently old and worn out), and what approaches should guide or delineate our search for answers or solutions. 

But lest I simply dwell in the past, I must obviously explore the knowledge of those living and breathing and walking as well. I mean, I'm a student of computer science. While I would love to start documenting my journey through CS at some point, I've only been doing CS for a year, whereas I've been writing and running and testing and debugging life.cpp for some time now... That's no excuse of course, as with anything there is always more room to grow. Yet, going back to the why of starting this "blog", in comparison, at the moment writing about or reading about programming wouldn't really make me a better programmer as much as actually...programming (e.g., figuring out jekyll). But I suppose we must all start somewhere, so I will start building my portfolio here and on github.

Essentially, this corner is just a side thing, to foster self-reflection and intentional dialogue, and growth. And moreover, to start conversations, so if you would like to further discuss anything here of interest, you will not find a reluctant conversationalist. All objections, reflections, etc, are welcome. An online platform is certainly useful for disseminating experiences and ideas. But the written expression of one's personal opinions for the sake of making oneâ€™s voice heard in the noise is <em>not</em> my primary purpose. In fact I am rather adversive to the idea of anyone weighing my words here with regards to any matter too heavily. 

Plus, there are many whose stories deserve voice and attention much more than mine. So, if there are more important things you need to be attending to, than, say, reading about the musings of an 18-year-old, why are you here? You're given [700,000 hours in this lifetime give or take, sleeping through 152,000, eating and drinking through 45,000, and pooping (etc.) through 10,000](https://theartofliving.com/time-quotes/). I know, I've rolled my eyes at such self-helpy words, but they usually contain some grain of truth and sometimes we are most blind to the obvious, so it wouldn't hurt to throw in a reminder here, if just for myself (Good thing re-reading one's past writing is slightly more tolerable than watching or hearing videos or recordings of onself).

Anyhow, as I have already gone on several tangents in this "introduction", 
we're off to a fantastic start.

TL;DR
This website will feature short pieces I've written on topics that matter to me, e.g., blurbs on books, culture, lessons learned... My art-related hobbies may be more implicitly sprinkled in - such as any photo you come across here. I will also continue sharing resources that may help current students in the IB (International Baccalaureate) Diploma program. Finally, this newbie is hunting for coding-related resources so please please please send them, as well as any relevant suggestions for making this website cooler, my way. 

Thank you and happy new year!
