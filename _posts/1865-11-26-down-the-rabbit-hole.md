Dear IB warriors,

Here is a list of some resources by IB teachers, graduates, etc., that will hopefully help you through your IB journey. In my IB days I searched around a lot, saved way too many links, and narrowed down some of the best resources out there. These currently relate to the external assessments, but I'm also working on resources for IA's. 

<em>Math Applications & Interpretations</em>

[Lots of exercises](https://www.christosnikolaidis.com/en/mai-exercise/) We love practice problems! 

[Mock Exams by Revision Village](https://www.revisionvillage.com/ib-math-applications-and-interpretation-hl/practice-exams/mock-exams-set-1-paper-1/) There are several sets, supposed to be IB-style mocks.

[Notes Kindly Shared by Other IB Students](https://sites.google.com/view/ibnotes2020/mathematics?authuser=0). I didn't actually use these, since I prefer to make my own notes to avoid falling into passive learning. Nevertheless, these do look quite thorough. Here's [another collection of notes](https://yuvalamichay.wordpress.com/ib-mathematics-notes-2014-syllabus/) by a student.
