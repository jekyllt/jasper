My name is Joanne and I'm a second-year student studying computer science
at Tufts University. Currently, Iâ€™m looking for a 2023 summer internship.

It's a goal of mine to explore and dive deeper into the programming world, of which I've only scratched the tip of the iceberg. It is exciting as a learner to continually hone current skills (C++) and pick up new ones like Javascript, React, HTML...

Besides that, I enjoy singing, playing the piano, sketching, photography, and reading philosophical books (Always open to thoughtful, deep conversations about truth, reality, ethics, and more!). Moreover, connecting to people of different cultures and interests always brings me great joy.
